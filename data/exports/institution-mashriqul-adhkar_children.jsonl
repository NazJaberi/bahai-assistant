Bahá’u’lláh, for instance, proclaims, “Blessed are they that occupy themselves in the House of Worship with the remembrance of Him Who is the Lord of the righteous!” 4 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that while the House of Worship is “built upon earth, in reality it is an institution of the Concourse on high” and its “pinnacles shall soar to the apex of heaven”. 5 In another Tablet He refers to it as “the dawning-place of lights and the gathering place of the righteous”, in which “noble souls … offer supplications, intone divine verses, and chant prayers with wondrous melodies” such that “the inmates of the Concourse on high hearken and call out, crying, ‘Happy are we; let all the world rejoice!’” 6 It is, the Master declares, “the first visible and manifest establishment of the Lord”, 7 being so momentous a structure that even the act of “laying but one brick for [it] or one of its dependencies is like unto building a lofty edifice”. 8 As Shoghi Effendi states, the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár is a “symbol and harbinger of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh”. 9 It is, in the words of the House of Justice, a beacon of light “against the gloom of hatred and inequity”. 10 Eight continental Temples now illumine the world, while local and national ones are beginning to emerge, each one summoning “all comers to worship the One Who is their Creator, their sovereign Lord, the Giver of Light to the world” 11 and galvanizing “an entire people to reach for a more profound sense of unified purpose”. 12 Each reminds us of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assurance that “a hundred thousand Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kárs shall be reared in glory, dignity, and utmost majesty”. 13", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "40317e000de71d89746c4fe7a504979d7d38e78ca3777af1c3dda89046b47bf0"}

Some of the concepts that may be gleaned from various passages in the compilation are discussed below.\n1. The Influence of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár\nIn the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh calls on the peoples of the world to build\nhouses of worship throughout the lands in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them as perfect as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them with that which befitteth them, not with images and effigies.

Verily, by His remembrance the eye is cheered and the heart is filled with light. 14\n‘Abdu’l-Bahá elaborates on the importance of this institution, referring to the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár as “the lodestone of divine confirmations” and “the mighty foundation of the Lord, the firm pillar of the Faith of God”. In the same Tablet, He states that the establishment of the House of Worship “is a means for the exaltation of the Word of God” and that the “praise and glorification emanating from it cheereth the heart of every righteous soul”. He thus exhorts the friends to “be occupied therein with prayer and the worship of God, the recitation of the verses and words of God, and the chanting of heavenly odes in glorification of the All-Merciful”. 15", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "fe8709a644b383d9ea44262ff082bfb98cb3b29f4065d5ca6b00e2d24d8dc4ad"}

A Place of Worship\n‘Abdu’l-Baha explains that “pure and radiant hearts are the dawning-places of the mention of God from which the melodies of supplication and prayer continually reach the Concourse on high”, and He states that should the hearts of the friends become divine temples through the bounty of God, “they would assuredly exert the utmost endeavour … to build the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, so that the outward frame may reveal the inward reality and the outer form give tidings of the inner meaning”. 27 Several themes are found in the writings associated with this place of worship and the inward reality it manifests, including the power of prayer, the effects of communal worship, and the nature of devotions within the central edifice itself.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "eccceb18958c7d92d93e0d98a06bea14309391ba33b6aa91eb71577f523e5639"}

Essential to this pattern, the House of Justice maintains, “is the devotional meeting—a communal aspect of the godly life and a dimension of the concept of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár”. 31 When “integrated into the core of community life”, such gatherings become “occasions where any soul may enter, inhale the heavenly fragrances, experience the sweetness of prayer, meditate upon the Creative Word, be transported on the wings of the spirit, and commune with the one Beloved”. 32 The holding of such gatherings is “a further step in the implementation” of the law of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, 33 one that evokes the spirit of the House of Worship in any locality. 34", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "a5133fa55220f09b0e3627444aa73f8dbc57561839fa740c157a5fc0cb636fb3"}

Subsequently, a continental House of Worship was established in seven other locations around the world, culminating in October 2016 with the inauguration of the Temple in Santiago, Chile. Yet, even as the continental stage was drawing to a close, a new horizon was opening up to the Bahá’í world owing to the growing momentum in community building—founded on collective worship and raising capacity for service—that had been stimulated by the series of global Plans beginning in 1996. In its Riḍván message to the Bahá’ís of the world that year, the House of Justice emphasized that “the flourishing of the community, especially at the local level, demands a significant enhancement in patterns of behaviour” involving “the practice of collective worship of God”. It was, therefore, “essential to the spiritual life of the community that the friends hold regular devotional meetings in local Bahá’í centres, where available, or elsewhere, including the homes of believers”. 61 In its Riḍván message five years later, the House of Justice anticipated the building of national Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kárs during the Fifth Epoch of the Formative Age, a development that would “unfold throughout successive stages of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan”. 62 Specifically, it observed:\nA feature of the Fifth Epoch will be the enrichment of the devotional life of the community through the raising up of national Houses of Worship, as circumstances in national communities permit. The scheduling of these projects will be determined by the Universal House of Justice in relation to the advancement of the process of entry by troops within countries. 63", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "c7810abab80f60840e0c7671f3d9aa9d9071e5bc5e45685e931c2e7aa9766e82"}

This was a highly significant development. “With the construction of the last of the continental temples in Santiago under way,” the House of Justice stated that year in its Riḍván message, “the initiation of projects for building national Houses of Worship offers yet another gratifying evidence of the penetration of the Faith of God into the soil of society.” 65 The House of Justice also affirmed in a subsequent letter written on its behalf that the House of Worship is “an integral part of the process of community building, and its construction represents an important milestone in the development of a community”. 66", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "131262f4c03954049de55967f4a63074a7317bcec28915b782875a8bfc28fd86"}

It should not be inferred, however, from this general statement that the interior of the central Edifice itself will be converted into a conglomeration of religious services conducted along lines associated with the traditional procedure obtaining in churches, mosques, synagogues, and other temples of worship.

To them will the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár symbolize the fundamental verity underlying the Bahá’í Faith, that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is not final but progressive. Theirs will be the conviction that an all-loving and ever-watchful Father Who, in the past and at various stages in the evolution of mankind, has sent forth His Prophets as the Bearers of His Message and the Manifestations of His Light to mankind, cannot at this critical period of their civilization withhold from His children the Guidance which they sorely need amid the darkness which has beset them, and which neither the light of Science nor that of human intellect and wisdom can succeed to dissipate. And thus having recognized in Bahá’u’lláh the Source whence this celestial light proceeds, they will irresistibly feel attracted to seek the shelter of His House, and congregate therein, unhampered by ceremonials and unfettered by creed, to render homage to the one true God, the Essence and Orb of eternal Truth, and to exalt and magnify the name of His Messengers and Prophets Who, from time immemorial even unto our day, have, under divers circumstances and in varying measure, mirrored forth to a dark and wayward world the light of heavenly Guidance.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "1abf6dff8e3ea3099becf490d1e9f99cf750f84c2e4314691df1ec7d7524b209"}

That the Temple Edifice should arise under such circumstances, that its elaborate and exquisite ornamentation should be carried out, through the efforts of a mere handful of Bahá’í followers despite the gloom, the uncertainty and the dangers which surround them, is but another evidence of the mysterious, all-compelling power of Bahá’u’lláh Whose blessings will be bountifully vouchsafed to all who arise to carry out His purpose.

It is with sacrifice that this Temple is to be built. This is the truly worthy method. This principle therefore excludes any method whereby the help of non-Bahá’ís is included.

For the best way in which you can effectively support the Temple cause is not through material means but by the moral help which is your primary obligation to extend to those who are in charge of the building of that sacred and unique Edifice. It is devotion, sincerity and genuine enthusiasm which in the long run can ensure the completion of our beloved Temple. Material considerations, though essential, are not the most vital by any means. Had it been otherwise the Temple would have never reached the stage of progress which it has already so well attained. For the resources of the community are limited, and have been severely affected during the last two years by an unprecedented and world-wide economic crisis. But despite all these material obstacles the Temple has made a steady progress and this alone is sufficient to convince every unbiased observer of the divine potency animating the Faith—a potency before which all material difficulties must inevitably wane.\n(From a letter dated 30 December 1933 to individual believers) [48]\nAs regards the chanting of Tablets in the Temple, Shoghi Effendi wishes in this connection to urge the friends to avoid all forms of rigidity and uniformity in matters of worship. There is no objection to the recital or chanting of prayers in the Oriental language, but there is also no obligation whatever of adopting such a form of prayer at any devotional service in the auditorium of the Temple. It should neither be required nor prohibited. The important thing that should always be borne in mind is that with the exception of certain specific obligatory prayers Bahá’u’lláh has given us no strict or special ruling in matters of worship whether in the Temple or elsewhere.

Those invited to break the ground with Him on that spring day came from diverse backgrounds—Norwegian, Indian, French, Japanese, Persian, indigenous American, to name but a few. It was as if the House of Worship, yet unbuilt, was fulfilling the wishes of the Master, expressed on the eve of the ceremony, for every such edifice: “that humanity might find a place of meeting” and “that the proclamation of the oneness of mankind shall go forth from its open courts of holiness”.\nHis listeners on that occasion, and all who heard Him in the course of His travels to Egypt and the West, must have but dimly comprehended the far-reaching implications of His words for society, for its values and preoccupations. Still today, can anyone claim to have glimpsed anything but an intimation, distant and indistinct, of the future society to which the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is destined to give rise? For let none suppose that the civilization towards which the divine teachings impel humankind will follow merely from adjustments to the present order. Far from it. In a talk delivered some days after He laid the cornerstone of the Mother Temple of the West, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated that “among the results of the manifestation of spiritual forces will be that the human world will adapt itself to a new social form,” that “the justice of God will become manifest throughout human affairs”. These, and countless other utterances of the Master to which the Bahá’í community is turning time and again in this centennial period, raise awareness of the distance that separates society as it is now arranged from the stupendous vision His Father gifted to the world.\n…\nIn our Riḍván message of 2001, we indicated that in countries where the process of entry by troops was sufficiently well advanced and conditions in national communities were favourable, we would approve the establishment of Houses of Worship at the national level, whose emergence would become a feature of the Fifth Epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith. With exceeding joy we now announce that national Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kárs are to be raised up in two countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Papua New Guinea. In these, the criteria we set are demonstrably met, and the response of their peoples to the possibilities created by the current series of Plans has been nothing short of remarkable.

In a span of a few decades, this group, originally consisting of a handful of families, was joined there by others and grew to a few thousand believers.

On a befitting tract of land in the centre of the city that had been obtained some years before with the consent of the Blessed Beauty Himself, facilities were built for communal well-being—a meeting hall, schools for children, a hostel for visitors, and a small clinic, among others.

Within such an environment of unified endeavour and progress, and fostered at every stage of development by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a magnificent House of Worship emerged—the most prominent edifice in the area. For over twenty years, the friends experienced the heavenly joy of having realized their lofty aim: the establishment of a focal point of worship, a nerve centre of community life, a place where souls gathered at daybreak for humble invocation and communion before flowing out of its doors to engage in their daily pursuits. While the forces of irreligion eventually swept through the region and thwarted hopes, the brief appearance of a Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár in ‘I sh qábád is an enduring testament to the volition and effort of a body of believers who established a rich pattern of life deriving its impetus from the power of the Creative Word.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "d12d06df8696cf07a1698e7eba55195925bcd753aae67b8369755bfaee147838"}

From that moment, the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár became inseparably intertwined with the fate of those dedicated servants of Bahá’u’lláh.

A collective centre of society to promote cordial affection, the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár stands as a universal place of worship open to all the inhabitants of a locality irrespective of their religious affiliation, background, ethnicity, or gender and a haven for the deepest contemplation on spiritual reality and foundational questions of life, including individual and collective responsibility for the betterment of society. Men and women, children and youth, are held in its embrace as equals. This singular and integral universality is captured in the very structure of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, whose design as a nine-sided edifice conveys a sense of completeness and perfection symbolized by that number.\nAs the place from which spiritual forces are to radiate, the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár is the focal point for dependencies to be raised up for the well-being of humanity and is the expression of a common will and eagerness to serve. These dependencies—centres of education and scientific learning as well as cultural and humanitarian endeavour—embody the ideals of social and spiritual progress to be achieved through the application of knowledge, and demonstrate how, when religion and science are in harmony, they elevate the station of the human being and lead to the flourishing of civilization. As your lives amply demonstrate, worship, though essential to the inner life of the human being and vital to spiritual development, must also lead to deeds that give outward expression to that inner transformation. This concept of worship—inseparable from service—is promulgated by the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár. In this connection Shoghi Effendi states:\nDivorced from the social, humanitarian, educational, and scientific pursuits centring around the Dependencies of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, Bahá’í worship, however exalted in its conception, however passionate in fervour, can never hope to achieve beyond the meagre and often transitory results produced by the contemplations of the ascetic or the communion of the passive worshipper.

It is the spiritual food that sustains the life of the spirit. Like the morning’s dew, it brings freshness to the heart and cleanses it, purifying it from attachments of the insistent self. It is a fire that burns away the veils and a light that leads to the ocean of reunion with the Almighty. On its wings does the soul soar in the heavens of God and draw closer to the divine reality. Upon its quality depend the development of the limitless capacities of the soul and the attraction of the bounties of God, but the prolongation of prayer is not desirable. The powers latent in prayer are manifested when it is motivated by the love of God, beyond any fear or favour, and free from ostentation and superstition. It is to be expressed with a sincere and pure heart conducive to contemplation and meditation so that the rational faculty can be illumined by its effects. Such prayer will transcend the limitation of words and go well beyond mere sounds. The sweetness of its melodies must gladden and uplift the heart and reinforce the penetrating power of the Word, transmuting earthly inclinations into heavenly attributes and inspiring selfless service to humankind.\n…\nWe have called upon the Bahá’ís to see in their endeavours of community building the creation of a new pattern of how society can be. Taken in its entirety, that pattern fosters capacity for service—for the education of young generations, for the empowerment of the youth, for the spiritual education of children, for the enhancement of the capacity to draw upon the influence of the Word of God in accompanying others into the field of service, and for the social and economic advancement of a people in the light of the divine teachings for the age. Essential to that pattern is the devotional meeting—a communal aspect of the godly life and a dimension of the concept of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár—which represents a marvellous opportunity for your community not only to worship the Almighty and seek His benedictions in your own lives, but to extend to your fellow citizens the spiritual energies of prayer, to restore for them the purity of worship, to kindle in their hearts faith in the confirmations of God, and to strengthen in them, no less than in yourselves, eagerness to serve the nation and humanity and to show constructive resilience in the path of justice.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "fe672533fb80b7ffd9be1570fb99f0349aa0029fb868c1165d4f09b1e3572011"}

Plant, then, the seeds of future Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kárs for the benefit of all, and ignite countless beacons of light against the gloom of hatred and inequity.\n(From a letter dated 18 December 2014 to the Bahá’ís in Iran) [67]\nThe systematic pursuit of the Plan in all its dimensions gives rise to a pattern of collective endeavour distinguished not only for its commitment to service, but also for its attraction to worship. The intensification of activity which the next five years requires will further enrich the devotional life shared by those who serve side by side in clusters around the world. This process of enrichment is already much advanced: witness, for instance, how gatherings for worship have been integrated into the core of community life. Devotional meetings are occasions where any soul may enter, inhale the heavenly fragrances, experience the sweetness of prayer, meditate upon the Creative Word, be transported on the wings of the spirit, and commune with the one Beloved. Feelings of fellowship and common cause are generated, particularly in the spiritually heightened conversations that naturally occur at such times and through which the “city of the human heart” may be opened. By convening a gathering for worship at which adults and children of any background are welcome, the spirit of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár is evoked in any locality. The enhancement of the devotional character of a community also has an effect on the Nineteen Day Feast and can be felt at other times when the friends come together.\n(From a letter dated 29 December 2015 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors) [68]\nThe Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár is “one of the most vital institutions in the world”. A Temple and its associated dependencies embody two essential and inseparable aspects of Bahá’í life: worship and service. As a potent symbol and an integral element of the divine civilization towards which Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ushers all peoples, the House of Worship becomes the focal point of the community from which it emerges. “The holy fragrances of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár”, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains, “vivify the souls of the righteous, and its vitalizing breezes confer life upon the pure in heart.” Indeed, its influence is such as to galvanize an entire people to reach for a more profound sense of unified purpose. The gaze of the Bahá’í world is at this hour fixed upon its newly dedicated Temple, and we are certain that this longed-for victory will bring jubilation to the friends everywhere. Yet they will surely not be content to simply rejoice amongst themselves. Inspired by all that this sublime edifice stands for, let them invite others to discover the abiding joy that comes from the praise of God and from service to humankind.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "75e232ac87276583de820bcd69c98a9e891ce7a5f139c00d6422cbe51282566f"}

For example, He lists a school for orphan children, hospital and dispensary for the poor, home for the incapable, college for higher scientific education and hospice. In another place after listing the foregoing institutions He states that other philanthropic buildings are to be built.… The Universal House of Justice has also said that it has not seen any text requiring that the number of dependencies should be nine.\n(From a letter dated 18 March 1974 to an individual believer) [71]\nA symbol of this process [Bahá’í involvement in development projects] may be seen in the House of Worship and its dependencies. The first part to be built is the central edifice which is the spiritual heart of the community. Then, gradually, as the outward expression of this spiritual heart, the various dependencies, those “institutions of social service as shall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the ignorant” are erected and function. This process begins in an embryonic way long before a Bahá’í community reaches the stage of building its own Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, for even the first local centre that a Bahá’í community erects can begin to serve not only as the spiritual and administrative centre and gathering place of the community, but also as the site of a tutorial school and the heart of other aspects of community life. The principle remains, however, that the spiritual precedes the material. First comes the illumination of hearts and minds by the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, and then the grass roots stirring of the believers wishing to apply these teachings to the daily life of their community.\n(From a letter dated 8 May 1984 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil) [72]\nThe term “Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár” has been used in the Writings to describe various things: the gathering of the friends for prayers at dawn; a building where this activity takes place; the complete institution of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, with its dependencies; the central edifice of that institution, often described as a “House of Worship” or “Temple”. These variants can all be seen as denoting stages or aspects of the gradual introduction of Bahá’u’lláh’s concept as promulgated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. For the development of the Ma sh riqu’l-A dh kár, several lines of action have been set in motion, and it is to these that the believers should devote their efforts and attention.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/institution-mashriqul-adhkar/institution-mashriqul-adhkar.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "99633f3b96c42616c55b9676d7adda2a4c41b2ebf36e83759f5dd6ffaf75652e"}

Currently, the first Houses of Worship of each continent serve as the national Temples of the countries in which they are located, and they also serve the communities in their vicinity, playing a significant role in local activities. As the process of growth unfolds, Temples will increasingly be raised at the national and local levels, and much will be learned about their nature and how they contribute to the community-building process. The many aspects of the functioning of this institution will then gradually be manifest.
