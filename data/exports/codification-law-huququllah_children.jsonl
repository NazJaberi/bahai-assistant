Preamble\nḤuqúqu’lláh (The Right of God) is a great law (13) 1 and a sacred institution. Laid down in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book , it is one of the key instruments for constructing the foundation and supporting the structure of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. It has far-reaching ramifications that extend from promoting the welfare of the individual to buttressing the authority and extending the activity of the Head of the Faith. In providing a regular and systematic source of revenue for the Central Institution of the Cause, Bahá’u’lláh has assured the means for the independence and decisive functioning of the World Centre of His Faith.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "1b9841fed228568276c66488edcc000ca806550dc071cf0328a13b7d458188b2"}

This law enables the friends to recognize the elevation of their economic activity to the level of divine acceptability; it is a means for the purification of their wealth and a magnet attracting divine blessings. The computation and the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh, within the general guidelines set forth, are exclusively a matter of conscience between the individual and God (56, 82); demanding or soliciting the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is prohibited (56, 82, 83, 93, 106)—only appeals, reminders and exhortations of a general nature, under the auspices of the institutions of the Faith, are permissible (94, 96, 97, 100). That the observance and enforcement of this law, so crucial to the material well-being of the emerging Bahá’í commonwealth (29), should thus have been left entirely to the faith and conscience of the individual gives substance to, and sheds light on, what the beloved Master calls the spiritual solution to economic problems. Indeed, the implications of the law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh for the realization of a number of the principles of the Faith, such as the elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty, and a more equitable distribution of resources, will increasingly become manifest as the friends assume in ever greater measure the responsibility for observing it.\nThe fundamentals of the law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh are promulgated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Further elaborations of its features are to be found in other Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, in Tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and in letters from Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, mostly in response to questions raised by the friends. All these major references have been compiled by the Research Department of the House of Justice and separately published. A study of that compilation makes it clear that the application of the law has been progressive, and will continue to be so, as its ramifications and subsidiary rulings are elucidated.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "6ce944382ab18dfa0a06c0b1ef2d54e728c0ecbef756bcbcd5dc8b07ee845e96"}

The questions put to Bahá’u’lláh, the Master and Shoghi Effendi were from friends residing in places and times with infinitely simpler economic systems and relationships than those which obtain today. What can be learned from them are clear guiding principles whose application to changing and more complex conditions must be considered. The subject will undoubtedly occupy the House of Justice in evolving legislation, as necessary, for a long time to come. As the Fifth Epoch of the Formative Age of our Faith unfolds before the eyes of an increasingly watchful humanity, the universal assumption of the obligation of Ḥuqúqu’lláh by the friends serves as a clear illustration of a new level of spiritual maturity being attained by the community of the Greatest Name throughout the world.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "530b66d914acfda24f2c3297b4d4d194651e15113e093e4bdee212e21bb55316"}

The principal residence as well as items such as necessary furnishings and tools of trade remain exempt (79).\nFurther notes on determining Ḥuqúqu’lláh: Each believer should learn not only how to calculate Ḥuqúqu’lláh during the course of his or her life but also how to provide for the payment of the balance remaining at the date of death (65, 68). Although the law provides a certain leeway in the timing of the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh, it should preferably be paid by a believer during the course of his or her life whenever it falls due (73); in this case the only payment to Ḥuqúqu’lláh which should be provided for by the will is such additional liability as may be found to exist when the believer’s financial affairs are determined at the date of death (65). One believer cannot discharge the obligation of another to pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh nor can a payment to Ḥuqúqu’lláh be earmarked for any purpose or be made in honour of anyone (64, 80). The law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh imposes an obligation only on individual believers, not on Bahá’í institutions or corporate bodies (76). It is left to the individual to decide which expenses are to be regarded as “necessary” and therefore deductible in computing the annual accretion to savings and which furnishings of the household are to be regarded as “needful” and therefore exempt from the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh (19, 45, 46, 48–50, 56–58, 61, 70). Although references are made to annual payments of Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the time and method of payment are left to the discretion of the individual believer (69, 72, 78). There is, therefore, no obligation to liquidate one’s assets in haste in order to fulfil one’s current obligations to Ḥuqúqu’lláh (55). Husband and wife are free to decide whether they want to honour their Ḥuqúqu’lláh obligations jointly or individually (59, 71, 74). The account of Ḥuqúqu’lláh should be kept separate from other contributions inasmuch as the disposition of the funds of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is subject to decision by the Central Authority in the Cause to which all must turn, whereas the purposes of the contributions to other funds may be determined by the donors themselves. Payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh has priority over making contributions to other funds of the Faith (49, 54, 57), as well as over the cost of pilgrimage (2). It is, however, left to the discretion of the believer whether or not to treat contributions to the fund as an expense when arriving at the value of his or her property in calculating the sum to be paid as Ḥuqúqu’lláh (57) or to make contributions only out of money on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh has been paid (62). He or she also has the discretion to treat some contributions in one way and some in the other (62).", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "53f08717310440311c94b650251f5957e901e90f23c66a058712bb3be923b078"}
