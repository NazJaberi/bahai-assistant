However, you should not neglect your health, but consider it the means which enables you to serve. It—the body—is like a horse which carries the personality and spirit, and as such should be well cared for so it can do its work! You should certainly safeguard your nerves, and force yourself to take time, and not only for prayer and meditation, but for real rest and relaxation. We don’t have to pray and meditate for hours in order to be spiritual.\n(23 November 1947 to an individual believer) [55]\nI might add that he does not believe any radiations of thought or healing, from any group, are going to bring peace. Prayer, no doubt, will help the world, but what it needs is to accept Bahá’u’lláh’s system so as to build up the World Order on a new foundation, a divine foundation!", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "ccb51774ff3b795f874bb9b6c74956759e5a409b6e26fb5dc47f97618a6d2045"}

Through Him you can address Bahá’u’lláh. Gradually try to think of the qualities of the Manifestation, and in that way a mental form will fade out, for after all the body is not the thing, His Spirit is there and is the essential, everlasting element.\n(31 January 1949 to an individual believer) [57]\nHe would advise you to only use the short midday Obligatory Prayer. This has no genuflections and only requires that when saying it the believer turn his face towards ‘Akká where Bahá’u’lláh is buried. This is a physical symbol of an inner reality, just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight—from which it receives life and growth—so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh, when we pray; and we turn our faces, during this short prayer, to where His dust lies on this earth as a symbol of the inner act.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "5bf113ea18afc4045fc6936725fd4fd667ca6224b6427feb880227a559c87b03"}

The few forms that there are—like those associated with the two longer obligatory daily prayers—are only symbols of the inner attitude. There is a wisdom in them, and a great blessing, but we cannot force ourselves to understand or feel these things, that is why He gave us also the very short and simple prayer, for those who did not feel the desire to perform the acts associated with the other two.\n(24 June 1949 to an individual believer) [58]\nHe suggests that you daily pray to Bahá’u’lláh to let you meet a soul receptive to His Message. The power of prayer is very great, and attracts the Divine confirmations. He, also, will pray for your teaching work there.\n(30 September 1951 to an individual believer) [59]\nHe thinks it would be wiser for the Bahá’ís to use the Meditations given by Bahá’u’lláh, and not any set form of meditation recommended by someone else; but the believers must be left free in these details and allowed to have personal latitude in finding their own level of communion with God.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude/importance-prayer-meditation-devotional-attitude.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "d51c3fe17a4d0a114871dbee259cbb359d0b6da2a90a0de1ad898c4a6f538839"}
