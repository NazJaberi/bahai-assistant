Sex relationships of any form, outside marriage, are not permissible therefore, and whoso violates this rule will not only be responsible to God, but will incur the necessary punishment from society.\nThe Bahá’í Faith recognizes the value of the sex impulse, but condemns its illegitimate and improper expression such as free love, companionate marriage and others, all of which it considers positively harmful to man and to the society in which he lives. The proper use of the sex instinct is the natural right of every individual, and it is precisely for this very purpose that the institution of marriage has been established.

Outside of marital life there can be no lawful or healthy use of the sex impulse. The Bahá’í youth should, on the one hand, be taught the lesson of self-control which, when exercised, undoubtedly has a salutary effect on the development of character and of personality in general, and on the other should be advised, nay even encouraged, to contract marriage while still young and in full possession of their physical vigour.

But it is clear from the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh that homosexuality is not a condition to which a person should be reconciled, but is a distortion of his or her nature which should be controlled and overcome. This may require a hard struggle, but so also can be the struggle of a heterosexual person to control his or her desires. The exercise of self-control in this, as in so very many other aspects of life, has a beneficial effect on the progress of the soul. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that although to be married is highly desirable, and Bahá’u’lláh has strongly recommended it, it is not the central purpose of life.

For unless some illustrious souls step forth into the arena of service and shine out resplendent in the assemblage of men, the task of vindicating the truth of this Cause before the eyes of enlightened people would be formidable indeed. However, if the friends become embodiments of virtue and good character, words and arguments will be superfluous. Their very deeds will well serve as eloquent testimony, and their noble conduct will ensure the preservation, integrity and glory of the Cause of God.\n(From a letter dated 19 December 1923 from Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá’ís of the East—translated from the Persian) [49]", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/chaste-holy-life/chaste-holy-life.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "08ef51cc04e4151018134b9490b9b31fad6177b6681a8aefc672ea657f688bcb"}

The present trend in modern society and its conflict with our challenging principles of moral conduct, far from influencing the believers to compromise their resolve to adhere undeviatingly to the standards of purity and chastity set forth for them by their Faith, must stimulate them to discharge their sacred obligations with determination and thus combat the evil forces undermining the foundations of individual morality.\n(From a letter dated 22 May 1966 written by the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer) [50]\nIt is the challenging task of the Bahá’ís to obey the law of God in their own lives, and gradually to win the rest of mankind to its acceptance.", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/chaste-holy-life/chaste-holy-life.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "0880264cd4eb36b517ce5750efc08554b12b56c0213a2d640aa7040957a1d69a"}

Here one must learn to control and direct one’s animal impulses, not to be a slave to them. Life in this world is a succession of tests and achievements, of falling short and of making new spiritual advances. Sometimes the course may seem very hard, but one can witness, again and again, that the soul who steadfastly obeys the law of Bahá’u’lláh, however hard it may seem, grows spiritually, while the one who compromises with the law for the sake of his own apparent happiness is seen to have been following a chimera: he does not attain the happiness he sought, he retards his spiritual advance and often brings new problems upon himself.\n(From a letter dated 6 February 1973 written by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in “Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1968–1973” (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 106) [51]", "source_url": "https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/chaste-holy-life/chaste-holy-life.xhtml", "lang": "en", "hash": "45c8a186d6eab9e31a734c5e3b9aa808254423362523eadc67aa8578f820de4f"}
